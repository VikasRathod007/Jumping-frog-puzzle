# Jumping-frog-puzzle
Ten frogs sit on a log - 5 green frogs on one side and 5 brown frogs on the other with an
empty seat separating them. They decide to switch places. The only moves permitted are
to jump over one frog of a different colour into an empty space or to jump into an
adjacent space. What is the minimum number of moves? What if there were 100 frogs
on each side? Coming up with the answers reveals interesting patterns depending on
whether you focus on colour of frog, type of move, or empty space.
